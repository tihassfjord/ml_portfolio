🎯 Portfolio Overview

This repository is my ongoing record of learning and building in machine learning. It covers everything from the basics to my attempts at more advanced, production-inspired systems. Some projects turned out well, others were more challenging than expected. I’ve tried to document both the successes and the things that didn’t go as planned, since that’s where most of the learning happened.

📊 Portfolio Stats

Total Projects: 27

Beginner: 5 (Fundamentals & EDA)

Intermediate: 5 (Deeper ML and deep learning)

Advanced Highlights: 12 (Research ideas and production experiments)

EDA Notebooks: 5 (Hands-on with real data)

🏆 Advanced Highlights

🧠 Mathematical Foundations

1. Neural Network from Scratch – NumPy only, with a lot of trial and error.


2. Character Language Model – Custom attention, no frameworks.



🚀 Production Systems

3. MLOps Pipeline – FastAPI, MLflow, monitoring, retraining. Not always smooth, but learned a lot.


4. Real-time Fraud Detection – Streaming ML with adaptive thresholds. Debugging was a big part.


5. Distributed ML System – Ray, Dask, PyTorch DDP. Every tool was a new adventure.



🎨 Advanced AI

6. Image Generation (DCGAN) – GANs for MNIST. Sometimes the results looked right.


7. Reinforcement Learning Game AI – DQN for CartPole. Not always stable, but worked in the end.


8. Real-time Face Recognition – OpenCV with webcam. Mixed results, but useful practice.



🔬 Research & Automation

9. Custom AutoML System – My own AutoML framework. Discovered what’s hard to automate.


10. Automated ML Pipeline – End-to-end pipeline. Not perfect, but good experience.


11. Multi-language NLP Pipeline – Transformers for multilingual text. Encoding issues happened often.


12. A/B Testing Framework – Toolkit for statistics. Using libraries makes more sense now.

🚀 Intermediate Projects

Advanced Linear Regression – Implemented gradient descent, fixed it when it diverged.

Image Classification System – CNNs on CIFAR-10. Input shapes caused some headaches.

Sentiment Analysis Engine – LSTM and traditional ML compared. LSTM took patience.

Stock Price Predictor – Time series predictions. More unpredictable than expected.

Movie Recommendation System – Hybrid recommender. Some recommendations were very unexpected.



---

📊 Beginner Projects

EDA Portfolio – First experience with data analysis and cleaning.

Iris Classifier – The classic. Simple, but not always accurate.

Titanic Survival Predictor – Feature engineering for survival prediction.

Housing Price Predictor – Regression for house prices. Some negative prices taught me a lesson.

Customer Churn Predictor – Business ML. Still learning what drives churn in reality.

🎯 Lessons Learned

Neural networks are fun, but challenging to debug.
Custom optimizers made me appreciate built-in ones.
Most production ML is just debugging and fixing new errors.
Distributed systems create unexpected problems.
Every new dataset needs a different approach.
Searching online is part of the process.
When stuck, taking a break really helps.

📈 Portfolio Impact

Mistakes and challenges were a big part of most of these projects, and honestly, that’s where I learned the most. If you’re learning ML or just interested, I hope this portfolio is helpful or at least shows the real process. Maybe you’ll avoid some of my mistakes, or at least recognize the experience.

If this portfolio helps with a job, research, or just gives some inspiration, that’s great. If not, I hope you find it interesting anyway.
