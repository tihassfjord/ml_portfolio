🤖 Advanced Machine Learning Portfolio

Author: tihassfjord
Portfolio: ML Engineering & Research Projects
Status: 27 Completed Projects | Production-Ready (as far as I can tell!)

🎯 Portfolio Overview

This repository is a collection of projects documenting my ongoing learning journey in machine learning—from the basics all the way to trying out production-like systems. My goal has been to explore, build, and understand each concept by working through practical problems. Each project represents something I wanted to learn (or needed to Google a million times), and where possible, I tried to make things work in the real world—not just in a notebook.

📊 Portfolio Statistics

Total Projects: 27

Beginner: 5 (Fundamentals & EDA)

🏆 Advanced Highlights (12 Projects I’m Most Proud Of)

🧠 Mathematical Foundations

1. Neural Network from Scratch – Built using only NumPy, just to see if I could (spoiler: it’s way harder than the tutorials make it sound)


2. Character Language Model – Text generation with custom attention, again without any frameworks



🚀 Production Systems

3. MLOps Pipeline – FastAPI + MLflow + monitoring + retraining (nothing like wrestling with Dockerfiles for humility)


4. Real-time Fraud Detection – Tried to make streaming ML “just work”; got a new appreciation for production monitoring


5. Distributed ML System – Ray, Dask, PyTorch DDP; still figuring out which one actually scales for my use cases



🎨 Advanced AI

6. Image Generation (DCGAN) – GANs for MNIST; because who doesn’t want to try GANs at least once?


7. Reinforcement Learning Game AI – DQN agent on CartPole; learned a lot about debugging “it just falls over”


8. Real-time Face Recognition – OpenCV with live webcam integration (learned more about lighting than I expected)



🔬 Research & Automation

9. Custom AutoML System – Built my own basic AutoML framework, mostly for the fun/challenge


10. Automated ML Pipeline – End-to-end automation with “intelligent” preprocessing (my attempt, at least)


11. Multi-language NLP Pipeline – Transformer-based text processing for multilingual data


12. A/B Testing Framework – Toolkit for statistical testing in data science projects

📈 Portfolio Impact

I’ve tried to cover the full stack of machine learning: from core algorithms to working systems and a few production tricks.
If this portfolio helps anyone else avoid the same mistakes I made, that’s a win.
Maybe it’s also useful for ML engineer or research roles, or for showing what I’ve actually built if you’re curious.
